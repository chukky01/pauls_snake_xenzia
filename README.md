# pauls_snake_xenzia
This is my own remake of the once popular mobile game snake xenzia
It is written in Python code
Here, one use the arrow keys on his keyboard to direct the snake
One must avoid hitting the wall or hitting one's tail or that's game over
At every point in time where the snake eats the food, it elongates
